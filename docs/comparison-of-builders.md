# Comparison of DiCy to other LaTeX Builders

There are many different automatic and semi-automatic builders for LaTeX-centric
documents. The [Compilation Topic][] at CTAN provides a current list of some of
those specifically designed for TeX or LaTeX documents.

In order to explain the intention of and capabilities of DiCy this document
compares DiCy to two of the most popular builders, [arara][] and [latexmk][].

## Summary

DiCy was designed to be used either from the command line or to be used from an
editor like Atom. It was also to designed to have capabilities that builders
like arara and latexmk lack.

-   Unlike arara, it automatically selects the appropriate rules to run. This
    includes the timing, the frequency and the order of each rule evaluated.
-   Unlike latexmk, its build procedure does not need to start with LaTeX and
    can start with preprocessors such as knitr.
-   It includes a larger default set of rules which describe how to run programs
    used in building LaTeX documents then either arara or latexmk.
-   Unlike arara or latexmk, it parses, filters and can display messages from
    log files generated during a build.

## arara

arara is a rule based builder which relies on directives given in the source
file to specify what programs should be run, the order in which they should be
run, and also the frequency in which they should be run. For instance, to build
a document with an index the following directives would need to be listed at the
beginning of the source document.

```latex
% arara: pdflatex
% arara: makeindex
% arara: pdflatex
\documentclass{article}
...
```

Any repeated calls of `pdflatex` need to be listed explicitly as arara does
not detect the need to run or rerun a program. The following command executed
from the command shell will build the document.

```shellsession
$ arara foo.tex
Running PDFLaTeX... SUCCESS
Running MakeIndex... SUCCESS
Running PDFLaTeX... SUCCESS
```

One can add new rules to arara and there is an extensive set of rules provided
as part of the default installation. Additionally, many of the rules can be
customized using options in the directive. For instance, to enable shell escape
and use German word ordering with makeindex one would use the following
directives.

```latex
% arara: pdflatex: { shell: yes }
% arara: makeindex: { german: yes }
% arara: pdflatex: { shell: yes }
\documentclass{article}
...
```

## latexmk

latexmk is a rule based builder selects the appropriate programs to run
including the frequency at which those programs to run automatically and without
explicit directives. For instance, to build a document with an index one need
only execute the following in a command shell.

```shellsession
$ latexmk -pdf -silent foo.tex
Latexmk: Run number 1 of rule 'pdflatex'
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) (preloaded format=pdflatex)
entering extended mode
===========Latexmk: Missing input file: 'foo.ind' from line
  'No file foo.ind.'
Latexmk: Run number 1 of rule 'makeindex foo.idx'
Latexmk: Run number 2 of rule 'pdflatex'
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) (preloaded format=pdflatex)
entering extended mode
```

Unlike arara, latexmk uses the log files and any file listings created by LaTeX
to determine which programs to run and whether document building has been
completed.

latexmk focuses on a small set of common rules and offers limited configuration
of those rules, usually by allowing one to override the command line used to
call the applicable program. New rules can be added by defining custom rules
triggered by file extension in various `latexmkrc` files. Custom rules do not
have the same priority as internal rules. Specifically, latexmk treats the
`latex` rule as a special primary rule which is run before all other rules. This
makes it difficult to run preprocessing rules such as knitr, lhs2TeX or Pweave
which are needed in literate programming or reproducible research documents.

## DiCy

Like arara, DiCy has an extensive set of rules including indexing, bibliography,
graphics and literate programming rules which can be individually configured.
Like latexmk, DiCy automatically selects the appropriate rules to run, including
the timing and frequency of each run. This means that, like latexmk, to build a
document with an index one need only execute the following in a command shell.

```shellsession
$ dicy build foo.tex
(INFO)    [LaTeX(build;execute;;foo.tex)] Executing `pdflatex -file-line-error
            -interaction=batchmode -recorder foo.tex`
(INFO)    [MakeIndex(build;execute;;foo.idx;foo.log-ParsedLaTeXLog)] Executing
            `makeindex -t foo.ilg -o foo.ind foo.idx`
(INFO)    [LaTeX(build;execute;;foo.tex)] Executing `pdflatex -file-line-error
            -interaction=batchmode -recorder foo.tex`
(INFO)    [DiCy] Produced `foo.pdf`
```

DiCy builds can be configured using command line options, using a YAML options
file or using TeX magic comments. For instance, to enable shell escape and use a
German word ordering with makeindex one could use the following TeX magic
comments in the main source file.

```latex
%!TeX shellEscape = yes
%!TeX indexSorting = german
\documentclass{article}
...
```

DiCy does not treat the LaTeX rule as a primary rule and all other rules as
secondary rules as latexmk does. This makes it easy to support literate
programming or multistage documents. For instance, no further configuration is
needed build a knitr document. DiCy will automatically process the file with
knitr, then process the result with the usual LaTeX build pipeline.

The automatic rule selection of DiCy is based upon log parsing, console output
and file listings, like latexmk. DiCy's automatic rule is more comprehensive
then that of latexmk, though. For example, DiCy will automatically call the
appropriate program if one uses packages that require follow-on scripts to
process output files such as [makeindex][], [epstopdf][] or [splitindex][].

### Log Parsing and Filtering

In addition to using parsed logs for automatic rule selection, DiCy can filter
and display log messages based on message severity. For example, the following
call to DiCy will build the document and then display all warning or error
messages from Asymptote, Biber, BibTeX, LaTeX, makeindex, mendex, splitindex,
upmendex, or xindy logs.

```shellsession
$ dicy build,log foo.tex
(INFO)    [LaTeX(build;execute;;foo.tex)] Executing `pdflatex -file-line-error
            -interaction=batchmode -recorder -shell-escape foo.tex`
(ERROR)   [LaTeX] Error: Command failed: `pdflatex -file-line-error
            -interaction=batchmode -recorder -shell-escape foo.tex`
(WARNING) [pdfTeX] No file foo.aux.
          [Log] foo.log @ 96-96
(ERROR)   [pdfTeX] Undefined control sequence
          [Source] foo.tex @ 12-12
          [Log] foo.log @ 111-111
(INFO)    [DiCy] Produced `foo.pdf`
```

Whereas the following call will display all messages including informational
only messages (`info` severity).

```shellsession
$ dicy bl --severity=info foo.tex
(INFO)    [LaTeX(build;execute;;foo.tex)] Executing `pdflatex -file-line-error
            -interaction=batchmode -recorder -shell-escape foo.tex`
(INFO)    [makeindex] Scanning input file foo.idx....done (1 entries accepted, 0
            rejected).
          [Log] foo.ilg @ 2-2
(INFO)    [makeindex] Sorting entries...done (0 comparisons).
          [Log] foo.ilg @ 3-3
(INFO)    [makeindex] Output written in foo.ind.
          [Log] foo.ilg @ 5-5
(INFO)    [makeindex] Transcript written in foo.ilg.
          [Log] foo.ilg @ 6-6
(INFO)    [pdfTeX] imakeidx 2016/10/15 v1.3e Package for typesetting indices in
            a synchronous mode
          [Source] foo.tex
          [Log] foo.log @ 27-28
(INFO)    [pdfTeX] Writing index file foo.idx
          [Log] foo.log @ 95-95
(WARNING) [pdfTeX] No file foo.aux.
          [Log] foo.log @ 96-96
(ERROR)   [pdfTeX] Undefined control sequence
          [Source] foo.tex @ 12-12
          [Log] foo.log @ 111-111
(INFO)    [DiCy] Produced `foo.pdf`
```

Log message display can be done as part of a build, or may be done after a build
has been completed since all parsed messages are stored in the build cache
`foo-cache.yaml` in this example. For instance, the following will display all
error messages.

```shellsession
$ dicy b foo.tex
(INFO)    [LaTeX(build;execute;;foo.tex)] Executing `pdflatex -file-line-error -interaction=batchmode -recorder -shell-escape foo.tex`
(INFO)    [DiCy] Produced `foo.pdf`
$ dicy l -s error foo.tex
(ERROR)   [pdfTeX] Undefined control sequence
          [Source] foo.tex @ 12-12
          [Log] foo.log @ 111-111
```

### Shared Configuration

DiCy loads the build configuration from external YAML option files or LaTeX
magic comments in addition to any options passed via the command line as
explained in detail in the section on [configuration][]. This makes it possible
to share the build configuration between the command line interface of DiCy and
the library interface of DiCy used in a builder such as [Atom LaTeX][]. From the
user perspective this happens automatically, so that building from [Atom
LaTeX][] via the `latex:build` command produces the same result as building from
the command line via `dicy b foo.tex`.

Since the same cache is used one can even query the parsed logs generated from
an [Atom LaTeX][] build from the command line using the methods described in the
previous section. DiCy also ensures that the in-memory cache is synchronized
with the on-disk cache.  This guarantees when building from the command line any
new rules or  dependencies created will be updated on the next build or cache
load requested by a library client such as [Atom LaTeX][].

## Program Support Across Builders

The following table is a summary of support that each builder has for common
programs used in processing LaTeX documents. In the table a closed dot (‚óè) means
that the builder has at least minimal support for the program, an open dot (‚óã)
means that support can be added via a custom rule or configuration option, and a
blank means that the builder is not known to support the program.
